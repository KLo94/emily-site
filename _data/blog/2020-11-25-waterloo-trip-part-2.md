Waterloo, Ontario

Memorable Moments:

1. Playing the relationship quiz

   The waterloo trip was never supposed to be a vacation.  It was just a trip where we could spend some time together and enjoy each other's company each day while working from the apartment.  Because we were working, our main time together came in the evenings.  On one evening, we decided to play the relationship quiz.  THE CONCEPT WAS SIMPLE.  There's a statement like "something your partner wears that you hate".  The goal is to guess what your partner would say for it.  Now, I know Emily is smart AF but for some reason it took like 15 minutes to explain the concept and whose perspective we were answering from.  In the end, she actually improved on the game slightly by suggesting we write both answers.  The really cool thing here was that we generally guessed each others answers perfectly.  (too bad she doesn't know that I hate doing dishes)
2. Visiting the alpacas on our nightly walks

   We took a walk ALMOST every night in Waterloo.  Its a REALLY good habit that Emily has.  If it weren't for her, I'd be lying down after dinner instead of walking.  We would almost always walk by the Waterloo farm where we would see their alpacas.  3 white ones (1 big, 2 small) and 1 brown one who did his own thing.  Apparently their butts look like mine? :( 

   We also saw a donkey.  Emily insisted it was a "horse thing" but it was a donkey.  I should have bet her.  (She owes me about $10k because we actually did have soda stream canisters at the apartment. )
3. Winning the Free Pudding at MeetFresh

   I love free stuff (please see the 30 dollar blog).  I also love meet fresh.  They were doing a scratch and win contest and we were able to win a free pudding!  Emily was pretty embarrassed by my excitement.  She also expressed disappointment in my idea to take the rest of the scratch cards for future use.  :( She compared it to my "theft" of 30 dollars.
4. The T&T trip

   I love Emily but we are not very compatible when it comes to trips to T&T.  She thinks I have a problem with buying too much but she NEVER WANTS TO BUY ANYTHING.  So restrictive!  

   She was on a call with her dad and it was my perfect opportunity to sneak out and go for a grocery run.  Without telling her, I snuck out of the apartment and ran across the street to T&T.  It was FREEDOM.  I started willing my cart with whatever snacks, meats, and vegetables that I wanted.  I felt so accomplished, so clever.  Blinded by hubris, I sent a photo to Emily gloating that I was at T&T.  I instantly regretted my decision and began to move erratically through the store hoping to hide from her when she came.  SUDDENLY she appeared behind me and shouted "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!".  I had a mini heart attack.

   We then spent the next 30 minutes arguing through the store over what to buy and what not to buy.  My sole defense against Emily was "the noise".  It was highly effective.  Probably the most fun I've had at T&T.
5. Singing "怎麼了" on the way home
