title: Happy Birthday Emily!
---
To My Amazing, Beautiful, Lovely, Caring, Conscientious, Thoughtful, Stupendous, Girlfriend, Emily,

Happy 28th Birthday!  I am so thankful that I have gotten to spend much of the last year with you!  I remember driving back from Rockaway beach and  texting you "Happy Birthday" last year.  You gave your usual "thanks! I feel so old." response.  Little did we know how things would have turned out.

You are such a big part of my life!  I can't believe we live together as a COUPLE \*french accent\* in a RELATIONSHIP \*french accent\*.  Its been nearly 4 months and I THINK we are getting the hang of it.  I look forward to dinners with you each day.  I genuinely enjoy our walks (especially now that I know that they help your gastroparesis).  I like exploring Seattle with you on weekends.  Most of all, I just enjoy seeing you every day....even if you're giving me your unimpressed face. 

I know things have not been easy lately especially with health and work issues.  You have been a trooper and persisted through each challenge so far.  I am sure we will find a way to solve the next few.  We are a team!  I am here to help you no matter what.  I want to help you be as happy as you can possibly be...even if that means that things are "just ok" hahaha.  

I hope you enjoy some of the surprises that I have in store for you.  You are SOOOO hard to trick/surprise and it has definitely been a challenge trying to pull them off while living with you and having my butt injury.  I cant even count the number of times you have looked over with that super suspicious look in your eyes.  

I hope this next year is truly wonderful for you and that each one after is amazing as well.  (28 is a pretty darn good number though!....so I have high hopes.)  

I love you Emily!

\-Kevin



PS: I tried to update some of the jokes on the site....maybe you can remember more. :)
