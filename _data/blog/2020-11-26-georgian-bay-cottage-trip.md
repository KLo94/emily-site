Where:

Georgian Bay, Ontario

Dates:

Sept 12, 2020

I took Emily on a day trip to my family cottage on Georgian Bay.  It had been less than a month of officially dating and she was going to meet my grandparents and my family (again).  On top of that, I also gave her about a weeks notice in advance.  üòÖ

Challenge 1: Meeting the family

Emily was definitely concerned about meeting both my family and my grandparents so soon.  I hadn't even met her family yet.  In any case, she turned into a bundle of nerves in the days leading up to the trip.  Fortunately (ish), we found out that my sister could potentially bring her boyfriend which would naturally divide the attention on Emily.  Unfortunately, this came with several challenges...

1) I had never officially spoken to him before.  The last time we were in the same house, I was frozen with rage and it took everything I had not to destroy him and send my sister to nun school.

2) He was somehow intimidated by Emily, in addition to being intimidated by my grandparents.  He believed that Emily would be TOO impressive with her Mandarin skills.  (potentially true? She did go to Peking University after all)

Needless to say, he ended up coming and it probably lightened the pressure overall.  Emily was also well prepared with her Mandarin, her impressive resume, her "well grounded" persona and the fruits we had purchased the day before.  She brought watermelon...there was an argument about whether we needed bowls and forks...(writing this now makes me upset so I wont document it)...but now she will be known for her watermelon.  üçâ



Challenge 2: ALMOST DYING IN THE MIDDLE OF GEORGIAN BAY...YES IM SERIOUS...I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE CONCERNED WHILE PADDLING IN MY LIFE.

Ever since we had started dating, I had wanted to take Emily paddling.  Does she love paddling?  Not exactly...  (In fact, this was MAYBE her 2nd time paddling in general).  Do I consider myself pretty damn good at paddling?  Hell yeah.  Would it be an attempt to show off my fading fitness and declining physical strength to the girl I had just started dating?  Damn straight. 

On top of all this, my family had just gotten a new fiberglass canoe at our cottage!  My grandma boasted that the whole thing was lighter than 30 lbs.  We donned lifejackets, grabbed our paddles and headed out!  

"Its windy, turn left and stay in the reeds." said basically everyone.  We followed this advice for all of 10 minutes until I decided to turn the other way and take the more interesting route towards the marina.  This was a fairly straightforward paddle.  (I would realize later that this was mostly because we had both the wind and current at our backs.)

About 30-35 minutes into our adventure, after admiring the gigantic lake side cottages, Emily snapped this photo:

Literally two minutes after taking the photo, we realized that we had drifted at least 500m-700m away from the shore.  We were also continuously drifting further and further.  The wind and current had picked up and it was a constant battle to even stay in the same place.  At this point, I'm just going to restate that it was Emily's second time paddling.  We spent about 30 minutes paddling super hard and LITERALLY spinning in circles on the spot.  We then managed to hit a groove, likely due to sheer desperation and we managed to get close to shore.  Our battle wasn't done yet though....

Once we were near shore, there was a strong current that prevented us from getting back to the cottage.  Emily suggested portaging across the shore all the way back.  In hindsight, this was the best and safest idea...and its basically how we got back.  Initially, despite everything that had happened, I still believed that we could make it back by paddling and I was also hesitant to carry the canoe that far across other properties.  Emily was able to snap me out of my delusion and we carried the canoe across several properties until we were able to make it back....alive.  

In addition to our trip to Misery Bay, this was one of those moments where both of us were in a high pressure, high stress situation.  Fortunately, we both communicated well, worked together and were able to laugh things off at the end of all of it.  I think thats something that I won't ever take for granted.  It is rare to be able to handle a situation like that together but I think it is even more rare to be able to smile and laugh about it afterwards.  We even took this picture with the canoes afterwards!  (note the look of relief on my face)

Once we were back, my 90+ year old grandpa took the time to troll us about our "adventure in the middle of the bay" while trying his very best to promote me to Emily as his favourite.  



PS: Emily caught her first fish!!
