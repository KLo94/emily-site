I HATE needles.  I always have.  Every single needle I have ever gotten has caused me stress, fear and mental anguish.  Blood draws and IVs stress me out even more because you need to get a needle for an extended duration of time.  Well...I needed a blood test.  Emily was INCREDIBLY kind and understanding about it.  In addition to reassuring me, she even went so far as to ensure that she could take the time from work to go with me for support!  

On the day of the test, we drove to the blood lab in silence or what I remember as silence.  In reality, it was Emily trying to make conversation to calm me down and me providing single word responses.  We got there and there was basically no line.  They had my name up on a TV screen showing that I was queued up next.  My eyes widened with fear.  A kind nurse sat me down and Emily stayed beside me.  She talked to me about Beijing, the food in China and how we should take a trip there.  It all sounded incredible and actually helped to take my mind off of what was about to happen.  

The nurse came in and began taking the blood draw.  As it was happening, both the nurse and Emily noticed that I wasn't breathing.  LOL I was frozen.  Thankfully, it was over before I knew it, at which point the nurse mentioned that she had to take another one from the other arm.  Both Emily and I were shocked.  I solemnly offered my other arm... "JOKING"...she said.    ðŸ˜‘
