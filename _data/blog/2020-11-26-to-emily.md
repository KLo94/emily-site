So, I'll just start off by saying that this isn't "good-bye"...

**This is "I'll see you soon!"**  

* Because I live in Seattle too and long term, long distance was something we were worried about this whole time.  Now we don't have to face it!

**This is "I am so proud and inspired by how you can follow your dreams with such tenacity and precision"**

* Seriously!  It was really impressive to see you go through the journey of interviewing, getting the job and navigating the visa process.  You put care into every step to make sure things were done right, all the way down to the smallest detail.  You did literally everything in your power to get where you want to be.  At the same time, when selecting jobs, you were pragmatic and you picked one where you can have a high impact.  I could not be more proud or humbled to be with you.

**This is "You're going to have so much fun with all the hiking and running in Seattle"**

* You already know this but theres a lot of hiking to do in Seattle and Washington State in general.  As a self professed, professional, expert hiker, you are going to love it.  Olympic National Park, the Cascades, Mt Rainer, Mt St Helens,...there are so many incredible places to hike and so many adventures to be had.   Also given that you are an asics wearing, professional, multi marathon runner, you will undoubtedly enjoy the running trails that criss cross Seattle. 

**This is "We had better have daily facetime calls"**

* I'm serious!  With the video on!  Don't think for a second that you're bothering me by calling either!  I'm being the needy one here.  Also, as you have mentioned before, I sleep so late that I am basically going to be operating on your timezone anyways!  There are no excuses :)

**This is "I love you"**

* You are amazing.  The time that we have spent together over the past few months has been really really special to me
