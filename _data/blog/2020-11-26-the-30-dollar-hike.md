Where: Toronto, Ontario

Emily and I go on hikes...a lot of hikes.  We enjoy them a lot...but thats also the thing to do when you're dating in the time of coronavirus and everything is closed or restricted.  Like many other Saturdays beforehand, we decided to go on a hike.  We were going to attempt to go to Rouge National Urban Park again, despite the parking lot being too crowded last time.  Instead of parking at the main parking lot, we actually parked at a different lot at a much further portion of the park....and that is where this magical, glorious, heartwarming story begins.    

As with any great hike, we took a picture of the trail map at the very start.  This is what all the pro hikers do so that they can navigate.  We are pro hikers.  Especially, me. ðŸ˜ƒ

Anyways, about 10 minutes into our hike on this magnificent trail, I spotted 30 dollars on the ground.  I knew it was at least 25 dollars because I could see the green 20 and the blue 5 dollar bills.  Before Emily could say a single word, I lunged forward and dove to the ground to snatch the sad, lonely money off the cold ground.  I rose, triumphantly and ran up to Emily in excitement, exclaiming that we would be "eating McDonalds for free" or "can she believe our luck?".  

This is where our story takes a surprising turn.  Instead of being matched with the same excitement and glee, I saw a look of shock and disgust on Emily's face that soon faded into disappointment and concern.  SHE WANTED TO GIVE BACK THE MONEY.  TO WHOM?!  IT WAS CASH.  ITS NOT LIKE WE HAD FOUND A WALLET OR SOMETHING (Let's be clear, I would definitely give back a wallet with all the cash in it)  

"It could be from the couple ahead of us!"

"Remember the boy scouts that passed by us! Its probably one of theirs! Maybe its their lunch money.  Maybe it's all they have!" 

"We need to talk to EVERYONE on the trail to see if they dropped 30 dollars in cash!"

"Taking that money is like stealing!"

She was serious.  100% serious.  It was at this point, that I knew that Emily would always be the morally superior, more compassionate, more righteous one in the relationship.  I do not even come close.  Honestly, I was still thinking of the things we could buy with the money and how we would get McFlurry's to celebrate.  I was thinking about how this was the most money I had EVER found on the ground.  I was thinking about making sure that I secured the money in my own wallet so that I didn't drop it myself.  I was thinking about LITERALLY ANYTHING EXCEPT GIVING THE MONEY TO SOMEONE ELSE.  

Ultimately, we agreed to disagree (though, weeks later, Emily DID eat snacks from T&T that I purchased with the 30 dollars).  It was also a funny topic to debate for the rest of the trip.  Here are a few photos of us with the money!
